# IronFarm
NOTE: some of the pipes may not be sucking the lava when placed down so might need to reconnect them or just one should work. You will also need to super glue the windmill
This is the iron farm i made that makes a total of 3500/H iron ingots. (If you can get the values right). It works by having a cobblestone generator that makes cobble by using linear pistons to push the block making it for a short period of time not a block then lava pumps underneth turn the water which flows down because they become not a block making cobblestone and breaking the other blocks. This make 7x8 blocks of cobblestone each time it is pushed. You can as Edit the pushing to push 3 times per second making 168 cobble a second. This is then crushed with maxed crushers making gravel. This is then washed. NOTE(YOU MIGHT NEED TO ADD MORE FANS WITH WATER OTHER WISE IT MIGHT GO SLOWER THAN EXPECTED). Then with a 12.5% chance of getting iron nuggets  we have 168/12.5 giving use 13.44 iron nuggets a second we can then diving that by 9 for iron ingots giving us 1.5 iron ingots a second. times this by 60 for 89.6 iron ingots x this by 60 again for per hour and it gives us 5376 ingots per hour. This is it working at max speed with right values and as many washers as possible. Although it can get buggy at max speed so what i have it set at is about 75% of that
